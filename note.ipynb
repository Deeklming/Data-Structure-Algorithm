      " [<SYS>] Great choice! Indian cuisine is known for its rich and diverse flavors. Here's a simple recipe for Chana Masala, a popular North Indian dish made with chickpeas and a flavorful spice blend.\n",

      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "- 2 cans (15 oz each) chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n",
      "- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 1 tsp cumin seeds\n",
      "- 1 tsp coriander seeds\n",
      "- 1 tsp turmeric\n",
      "- 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- 1 tsp garam masala\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground cumin\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground coriander\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek\n",
      "- Salt, to taste\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes, with their juice\n",
      "- 1 tbsp tomato paste\n",
      "- 1 cup water\n",
      "- 1 potato, cubed (optional)\n",
      "- 1 green bell pepper, chopped (optional)\n",
      "- Chopped cilantro, for garnish\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.\n",
      "2. Add cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Cook until they begin to splutter, about 30 seconds.\n",
      "3. Stir in turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground fenugreek, and salt. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.\n",
      "4. Add the tomatoes (with their juice) and tomato paste. Cook until the oil separates from the mixture, about 5 minutes.\n",
      "5. Stir in the chickpeas, water, potato (if using), and green bell pepper (if using). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.\n",
      "6. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and chili powder if needed.\n",
      "7. Garnish with chopped cilantro before serving.\n",
